First, please make sure that you have previously performed the pre-processing, GSEA and topic-modelling steps, see [Pre-processing](pre-processing.html) and [topic-modelling](topicmodel_visualization.html).

The GSEA and topic modelling results can be explored interactively in the built-in Shiny web application.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(CellFunTopic)
visualize_in_shiny(SeuratObj)
# It should be noted that an object named "SeuratObj" is needed in your global environment.
```

The Shiny app is demonstrated in the following image:
